# Koh's Portfolio

This project is a personal portfolio website for showcasing skills, works, and contact information. The website is structured using HTML, styled with CSS, and includes JavaScript for interactive features.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main structure of the webpage, containing sections for About, Works, Skills, and Contact information. This file will be updated to include a menu icon for navigation.
  
- `main.css`: The stylesheet for the webpage, which will be updated to style the menu icon and the dropdown menu.

- `js/menu.js`: This JavaScript file contains the functionality for the menu icon, allowing users to toggle the visibility of the menu links.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to be responsive and user-friendly on various devices.
